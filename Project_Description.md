# Pesticide_Assistant_APP
It's a  project for detecting the pesticide name from the bottle photo taken by the camera using Machine learning algorithms and then displaying the amount of pesticide required for 1 liter of water using visual/ progress bar.


# project description : 

1) In this project we have developed an android application that is capable of taking a photo of real objects and performs the following procedure.

2) After capturing of image the it is passed to the Machine learning model. Here we have used the classification problem to make a ML model.

3) The output from the ML model is feed to the next activity of android app for choosing from the available crops.

4) After choosen crops on the last activity with the help of customized progress bars we have shown the concetration of water and pesticide side-by-side.

5) Here our app process ends and user can go back rechoose the crop to another result.

Technologies used for this project:
1) Andriod studio for app development.
2) IC launcher genrator for making app laucher icon.
3) pycharm for ML model developement.



Note : 
1) Android app made in this project is limited for only three classes of pesticides detection and two crop options.
2) one bug is user needs the restart of app for next pesticide detection.( will fix this bug in future.)
3) In this project my contribution is complete android app developement.
